## Git guidelines
In general, the preferred Git workflow is:

1. Create a branch from `master`, check it out, do your work.  
Please, use required branch name from the task. If task name consist of two words, use `-` for separating. For example:  
~~taskName~~, ~~task_name~~, `task-name`

2. Commit changes. Required commit name is `TASK_NAME[/TYPE]: message`.  

| Good commit naming  |Bad commit naming|  
|:--------------------|:----------------|
|`binary-tree/feature: implement traverse method`|  `init commit`   |
|`binary-tree/fix: error in the empty tree`|`fix`|
|`youtube: rename constans`|`чейнджи`|

_After that optionally push your branch up to the remote repository_



## GitHub Pull Request (PR) guidelines

1. PR name should contains **the task name** and probably additional info.
2. Changes **must not contain commented code, unnecessary files, changes from another branches and generated files** like *.bundle.js. Please review your changes before contributing. .editorconfig, .gitignore, etc. can be included.
3. Comments in the PR are good practice.

## Git cheatsheet  
Git allows a developer to copy a remote subversion repository to a local instance on their workstation, do all their work and commits in that local repository, then push the state of that repository back to a central facility (**github**).

|`git clone git@github.com:r/r.git`| Get a copy of the central storage facility (the repository)   |
|`git branch first-task`|Create a _local_ branch called "first-task" |
|`git checkout first-task`  |Swith to the first-task branch |
|`git checkout -b first-task`  |Create and swith to the first-task branch |
|`git add index.js`  |Add `index.js` contents to the index.|

|`git push origin first-task`  |Push the current state of your `first-task` branch, including all commits, up to github.|
